## Basic Transistor Characterizations Notes

### I<sub>SD</sub> as a function of V<sub>G</sub>
source1 -> Sweep gate voltage
source2 -> Apply some SD voltage and measure ISD

In this measurement we need to collect the ISD. But we can also collect the IGS (leakage current)

### I<sub>SD</sub> as a function of V<sub>SD</sub> for various V<sub>G</sub>
source2 -> Apply gate voltage
source1 -> Sweep SD voltage and measure ISD

In addition to ISD, we can collect IGS and we can calculate S/D resistance as well as G/S resistance
